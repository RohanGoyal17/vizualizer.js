# vizualizer.js
Devising a method to make css properties audio sensitive

use vizualizemp3convert to obtain an array of frequencies

use case example available in viz.js and opacity.html

index.html provides an algo to autorun songs and change the data source after the completion
(note: 123.mp3 is necessary for the autorun functionality, a small loophole found in chrome's security)
